Quick Start character creation? (y/n): 
Quick Start selected! Your character is Rynn, a Maithar Highborn born under the sign of Ember.

--- Your Story Begins ---

    You awaken to the gentle lapping of waves, the caress of seafoam at your feet, a stark contrast to the tempest that raged just hours before. Your body lies heavy upon the wet sand, each breath a testament to your survival against the capricious wrath of the sea. As your eyes flutter open, the blurred edges of reality sharpen, revealing the sun-drenched shores of some land unknown to you, Rynn.

Memories flash like lightning across the firmament of your mind â€” the creaking of wood, the howl of the storm, the desperate cries of your companions now lost to the abyss. The details of your past voyage are as scattered as the flotsam strewn about the beach, but one thing is clear: you are far from home.

This land greets you with its wild, untamed beauty. Towering cliffs crowned with verdure rise to the east, and to the west, the ocean spans the horizon, a sapphire sheet etched with the gold of the dawning day. 

Now, as destiny's hand guides you forth from the shores of providence, you stand at the threshold of a new beginning. Here, amidst the echoes of a history both grand and cruel, you, a Maithar of Highborn origin, born under the sign of Ember, will find your place in the stories yet unwritten. Your journey begins not with the remembrance of whence you came, but with the promise of what lies ahead.

With the salt on your lips and the horizon calling, you rise. The path before you is fraught with shadows and light, danger and opportunity. Every step is a story, and every choice carves the key to your future.

As you take your first steps into the unknown, you can't shake the feeling that your arrival was no mere accident. The threads of destiny are woven tight around your fate, and only time will reveal the role you are to play in this new world. 
    

Welcome, Rynn the Maithar Highborn, born under the sign of Ember. Your journey begins now...
